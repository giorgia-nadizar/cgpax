# Abstract
In most high-risk applications, interpretability is crucial for ensuring system safety and trust. 
However, existing research often relies on hard-to-understand, highly parameterized models, as, e.g., neural networks. 
In this paper, we focus on the problem of policy search in continuous observations and actions spaces, and we leverage two graph-based Genetic Programming (GP) 
techniques&mdash;Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) and Linear Genetic Programming (LGP)&mdash;to develop efficient yet interpretable control policies. 
Our experimental evaluation on eight Mujoco suite benchmarks shows competitive results compared to state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. 
Moreover, our policies, being represented by small-sized graphs, are simple and transparent, paving the way for trustworthy AI in the domain of continuous control.
